camp
====

Another Raspberry Pi camera webserver.

![](img/example.png)

What it does
============

Hosts a website where you can view your webcam in real time.

Why I wrote it
==============

There are a *lot* of tutorials out there on how to turn your pi into a webcam
server. Most of them involve installing [motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion),
which works great in many use cases. However, I wanted something simpler. Namely,
I wanted:

 * Minimal configuration
 * Password protection
 * One-way streaming
 * Easily customizable webpage
 * Extensible server

camp does just this. Nothing else. This (hopefully) makes it the simplest
and fastest option out there.

Installation
============

Camp uses [tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/) to create a
web server. It can interact with the [Pi camera](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1367)
with the aptly named [picamera](http://picamera.readthedocs.org/en/release-1.7/)
module, or it can use USB webcams with [opencv](http://opencv.org/)
and [Pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html). The
command below installs both sets of dependencies.

```
sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip python-opencv libjpeg-dev
sudo pip install tornado Pillow picamera
```

Once the dependencies are installed on your pi, you can clone this repository and
run the server.

```
git clone https://github.com/patrickfuller/camp.git
python camp/server.py
```

Navigate to http://your.r.pi.ip:8000 and check out your webcam.

####USB Camera

Use with `python server.py --use-usb`.

####Password

![](img/login.png)

With the `--require-login` flag, camp will open a login page before allowing
webcam access.

The default password is "raspberry". In order to change it, run this in your
camp directory:

```
python -c "import hashlib; import getpass; print(hashlib.sha512(getpass.getpass())).hexdigest()" > password.txt
```

This will prompt you for a password, encrypt it, and save the result in
`password.txt`.

Note that this level of password protection is basic - it's fine for keeping the
occasional stranger out, but won't stand up to targeted hacking.

####Run on startup

It's nice to have your pi start camp whenever it turns on. Let's make that
happen. Type `sudo nano /etc/rc.local` to open this file for editing, and add
the line `nohup python /home/pi/camp/server.py &` before the last line. Note
that you may need to change the path (`/home/pi/camp/server.py`) to point to
the right file.

####Customization

The website consists of `index.html`, `login.html`, and `style.css`. These can be
edited to change the look of camp.

If you want to add in extra functionality, edit `client.js` and `server.py`.
The client should send a request to the server, which will then cause the
server to do something.

If you want to add in extra camera features, opencv comes with a lot of useful
computer vision algorithms. Check out its functionality before writing your
own.
